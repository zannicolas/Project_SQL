# Data Analyst Job Market — SQL Project

**One-line:** SQL analysis to identify top-paying data analyst roles, in-demand skills, and which skills correlate with higher salaries.

**Goal:** Show my SQL work and results so employers can quickly see what I did and hire me.

---

## What I did
- Queried a job-postings dataset to answer five practical questions about the data analyst job market.
- Kept analysis reproducible: all SQL scripts are in `project_sql/`.
- Focused on remote-friendly roles and salary-based comparisons.

---

## Quick summary of the analyses (what to look for)
1. **Top-paying Data Analyst Jobs** — list top remote-paying roles.
2. **Skills for Top-Paying Jobs** — which skills appear in the highest-paid roles.
3. **Most In-Demand Skills** — which skills appear most often in job listings.
4. **Skills Based on Salary** — average salary per skill.
5. **Optimal Skills to Learn** — skills that combine high demand and high salary.

## Key SQL queries (same as used in the project)

### 1) Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
```sql
SELECT	
	job_id,
	job_title,
	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2) Skills for Top Paying Jobs
```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT

SELECT
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
